Hey there! Thanks for sharing your code.

This `sum` function is very concise, which is great, but it has a significant dependency that could lead to unexpected behavior and make your code harder to manage in the long run.

**The Problem:**

The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope. This means your function relies on `a` and `b` being defined globally or in an outer scope.

1.  **Global Dependency:** If `a` and `b` are global variables, your function's output will depend on their current global values. This makes the function less reusable and harder to test because it's not self-contained.
2.  **Potential Errors:** If `a` and `b` are not defined *anywhere* accessible to the function, calling `sum()` would result in a `ReferenceError` (especially in strict mode).

**Suggested Solution:**

The best practice for functions that operate on specific values is to pass those values as **arguments**. This makes your function self-contained, reusable, and predictable.

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Why this is better:**

1.  **Reusability:** You can now sum any two numbers you want, not just the ones defined as `a` and `b` globally.
    ```javascript
    console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8
    console.log(sum(100, 200)); // Output: 300
    ```
2.  **Predictability:** The function's output depends *only* on its inputs, making it much easier to understand, debug, and test.
3.  **Readability:** It's immediately clear what inputs the `sum` function expects and needs to perform its operation.
4.  **Avoids Global Pollution:** You prevent cluttering the global scope with variables that might conflict with other parts of your code.
5.  **Error Prevention:** No more `ReferenceError` if `a` and `b` aren't defined elsewhere.

**Further Efficiency/Cleanliness (Modern JavaScript):**

For such a simple operation, you could also write this as an arrow function, which is more concise:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

This achieves the exact same result while being even more succinct.
